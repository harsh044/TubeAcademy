                Our Founding Story
              </h1>
              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
              At Tube Academy, we believe that learning should be accessible, flexible, and rewarding. Our journey began with the simple idea of leveraging the vast educational content available on YouTube to create a structured, easy-to-follow learning experience. We noticed that many learners struggled to find quality, organized resources, and we saw an opportunity to make a difference.
              Our platform was founded with the goal of transforming YouTube playlists into comprehensive courses, allowing students to learn at their own pace. We wanted to make it possible for anyone, anywhere, to access high-quality education, whether for career growth, personal development, or passion projects.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
              With Tube Academy, learners can not only gain valuable skills but also earn certificates to showcase their accomplishments. We're committed to providing a seamless, engaging learning journey that empowers students to unlock their potential.
              Join us as we continue to innovate and shape the future of online education, one playlist at a time.
